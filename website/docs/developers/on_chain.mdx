# On-Chain

The Stellar smart contract can be directly used and inspected either using an explorer or via the convenient [Stellar CLI](https://github.com/stellar/stellar-cli). See the [contract address](./dapps_and_contracts.mdx).

## Typical flow

The first step is to register a project by providing some information. This will notably check that the maintainer doing this action owns a [Soroban Domain](https://sorobandomains.org/) for the project's name. If that's not the case, it will attempt to register one for a year.

```bash
stellar contract invoke \
	--source-account G... \
	--network testnet \
	--id C... \
	-- \
	register \
	--maintainer G... \
	--name tansu \
	--maintainers '[G...,G...]' \
	--url https://github.com/your_project/tansu.toml \
	--hash toml_hash \
	--domain_contract_id C...
```

Then maintainers can commit changes on-chain as they push new commits.

```bash
stellar contract invoke \
    --source-account G... \
    --network testnet \
    --id C... \
    -- \
    commit \
    --maintainer G... \
    --project_key ... \
    --hash ...
```

Later on, anyone can fetch on-chain data about a project and verify the last commit hash for themselves.

```bash
stellar contract invoke \
    --source-account G... \
    --network testnet \
    --id C... \
    -- \
    get_commit \
    --project_key ...
```

## Events

Registering a project or committing a new hash, sends a contract event off-chain.

These events are ingested by a backend to make them easily consumable off-chain.

## Git Hooks

There is a convenient pre-push hook which can be used. This ensures that a commit is only pushed if the hash is sent properly on-chain first.

```bash
pre-commit install -t pre-push
```
