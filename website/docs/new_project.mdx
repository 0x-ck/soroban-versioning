# Register a new project

The first step into Tansu is to generate your project. After doing a search in the search bar, you will be prompted to register your project. Only 15 characters are allowed. Registering a project will register a domain with the same name on [Soroban Domain](https://sorobandomains.org/) if the maintainer making the registration does not already own the domain.

:::warning[Domains]

Only register projects you are a maintainer of and are allowed to register. The domains are protected by the collateral system from Soroban Domains.

:::

When registering a project, you will be asked to provide the hash of a `Tansu information file`. This is the SHA256 of the `tansu.toml` which is hosted at the root of your repository. This file holds metadata for your project and the dApp is using the data to make a nice project card. So be sure to fill it! If you are not yet ready or cannot provide this file on your repository, just put a random hash.
